This folder contains MATLAB scripts to compute cosmogenic muon production for:

* Constant GCR fluxes, but allowing uncertainties in production rates.
* Linearly increasing or decreasing the GCR flux.
* Step-like increases or decreases in the GCR flux.
* Burst-like increases in the GCR flux.
* Instantaneous spikes in GCR flux.
