% Simple model for Dome C cosmogenic 14CO accumulation.
% This is a more standalone version that does not require the firn model
% to be run immediately before this model is run. Still calls the
% Balco_P_mu_total script
% The model calculates 14CO below â‰ˆlock-in depth using the Balco muon 
% parameterization adjustable tuning factors (F*Omega) that account for the
% fractional reduction (F) in total 14C production rate as compared to the 
% original Balco / Heisinger parameterizations, and for the fraction of
% total produced 14C that forms 14CO (Omega). These tuning factors are
% based on the range of values that seem plausible given our TG and Summit
% 14CO results
% This  version of the model moves the ice layers (model boxes) down
% each year as prescribed by a depth - ice layer age scale
% Also allows to investigate effects of production rate that is changing with time
% By Vas Petrenko. Modified from "Deep_Ice_14CO_standalone.m"
